# About

This is a full stack MERN project I've been working on for the past few weeks. It is a url shortener web app including auth system, real time db and pagination. This is one of my favorite projects because I have built it from scratch, excluding the UI design files.

I've made this project for the Frontend Mentor challenge: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G/hub/url-shortening-api-landing-page-u0bVtm9qW
